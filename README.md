# Job App

**Job App** is a React-based application that allows users to add, remove, and filter job listings. It integrates state management with Redux Toolkit, and features asynchronous data fetching and notifications.

## Features

- **Add Job**: Users can fill in job details and add a new job to the list.
- **Remove Job**: Users can delete jobs from the list.
- **Filter Jobs**: Users can filter jobs based on different criteria (e.g., job title, category).
